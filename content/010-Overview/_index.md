## Overview

Prerequisite: Genesys Cloud CX Channel Setup https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/gride-demo/

Architect is an easy-to-learn drag and drop web-based design tool that creates flows for media types. Architect uses menus and straight-to-queue logic most often associated with traditional auto-attendants. However, it also incorporates advanced, feature-rich logical operations such as non-menu digit collection, External Data Access (data dips), conditional logic, and expression editing to help develop the IVR functionality. Architect also provides centralized prompt management with multi-language support.

Objective: In this course, you’ll walk through the process of building a basic IVR Inbound Call Flow. We’ll discuss naming conventions, set language options, and discuss speech recognition. You’ll leverage the flow toolbar to customize and configure the route path a call takes when entering the IVR. Learning to add audio prompts, use unique identifiers, and decide the route taken based on the contact center schedule. Lastly, we’ll test the route before running it to a “live agent.” This course we’ll get you started in understanding the basics of Architect, before moving on to our level 200 course for more in-depth customization.
